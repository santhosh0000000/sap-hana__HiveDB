# sap-hana__HiveDB
The code appears to read configurations from a CSV file (test.csv) and, for each configuration, attempts to read data from an SAP table and then write that data to a Hive table.

Import Statements

import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import pandas as pd
import sys
Here, you import the necessary Python packages: pandas for data manipulation and analysis, SparkSession from PySpark for working with Spark, and sys for interacting with the Python interpreter (used later for exiting the script in case of an error).

Function: spark_con

def spark_con():
    # ...
This function initializes a Spark session with various configurations. If the session is successfully created, it returns the session object; otherwise, it prints an error message and returns None.

Function: main

def main(sap_server, schema, table_name, hivedb, spark):
    # ...
The main function does the bulk of the work:

It constructs a JDBC URL using the sap_server parameter.
It reads data from an SAP table using Spark's JDBC reader. The table is specified by the schema and table_name parameters.
If the data frame is empty (i.e., the table had no data), it exits early.
Otherwise, it repartitions the data frame to have 200 partitions.
Finally, it writes the data frame to a Hive table using the ORC format. The Hive table is specified by the hivedb and a sanitized version of table_name.
Script Main Body


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # ...
In the script's main body:

You read the configurations from a CSV file named 'test.csv' using pandas.
You obtain the total number of rows in the CSV file to determine how many configurations there are.
You create a Spark session using the spark_con function.
If the Spark session creation fails, it prints an error message and exits.
Then, you loop over each configuration in the CSV file (i.e., each row in the pandas data frame), extracting the necessary parameters and calling the main function to transfer data from an SAP table to a Hive table.
Summary
Script Objective: The script is a utility for transferring data from SAP tables to Hive tables. It reads configurations from a CSV file, where each row represents a different SAP-Hive table transfer task.
Input: A CSV file with columns host, db, table, and destination specifying the SAP server, schema, table name, and Hive database for each transfer task, respectively.
Output: For each row in the CSV file, the script attempts to read data from the specified SAP table and write it to the specified Hive table. If successful, the SAP table's data will be stored in the Hive table in ORC format.
Error Handling: The script contains error handling to manage issues that might occur during Spark session creation, data reading from SAP, and data writing to Hive. It prints error messages to the console if errors occur.
Configuration: The script uses a fixed configuration for the Spark session. Certain parameters (like SAP username and password) are hardcoded in the script.
